Hello there! My name is Max. Iâ€™m a quantitative social scientist passionate about hierarchical Bayesian modeling, especially in Stan. I've always had an intereset in politic and economic phenomena and how to make sense of them trhough models and data. I strongly believe that domain expertise through informed priors and quantification of uncertainty through probabilistic reasoning are pinnacle of statistical modeling. I love exploring data, building bespoke models, and visualizing key insights. Check out my [CV](/about/cv/max-mantei-cv-en.pdf) for more info about me.
